# The contents of this file should be a list of entries, one per line.
# Each entry consists of a site name and any number of key=value parameters,
# space-separated.
#
# The parameters are as follows:
#
#       count: The number of characters in the generated password.
#
#         set: The character set used to generate the password, as a string of
#              individual characters and ranges. Ranges are represented as a-b,
#              where a is the first character in the range and b is the last.
#              Hyphens and backslashes can be escaped using backslashes.
#
#        work: The bcrypt logarithmic work factor, from 4 to 31.
#
#   increment: An integer. Defaults to 0. Increment it to generate a new
#              password for the site, e.g. in case the previous one was
#              compromised.
#
# “default” is a special name that defines default settings.
# It must be present and the first entry.

# Override the default settings for sites as necessary.
